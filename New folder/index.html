      <h2>Zoamato Demo</h2>
      <p>My project is a web application inspired by Zomato, created using HTML and CSS. It offers users an intuitive interface to explore restaurants, browse menus, and make reservations. Leveraging HTML's structural elements, I designed a user-friendly layout that allows seamless navigation. CSS styling was employed to enhance the visual appeal, with attention to detail in color schemes and typography.

        The homepage features a dynamic search bar where users can input location preferences and cuisine choices, facilitating personalized recommendations. Restaurant listings are presented with enticing imagery and concise descriptions, enticing users to explore further. I incorporated responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various devices, optimizing the user experience. </p>

      <h3>Quora</h3>
      <p>My project on Quora, developed using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS, represents a culmination of my skills in front-end web development. Inspired by the popular Q&A platform, I meticulously crafted a user interface that mirrors Quora's intuitive design and functionality. Leveraging the power of Bootstrap, I ensured responsiveness across various devices, providing users with a seamless experience regardless of their screen size.

        The project encompasses a range of features akin to Quora, including user authentication, question posting, answering, and voting. By meticulously structuring the HTML elements and applying CSS styling, I achieved a visually appealing layout that enhances user engagement and readability.
        
        Moreover, I implemented interactive components such as upvoting and commenting, fostering dynamic interactions within the platform. Through this project, I honed my skills in UI/UX design, frontend scripting, and responsive web development.
        
        Attention to detail was paramount throughout the project's development, from designing intuitive navigation to ensuring accessibility standards compliance. Additionally, I prioritized performance optimization, utilizing Bootstrap's grid system and CSS optimizations to enhance loading times and overall user experience.
        
        Furthermore, I incorporated modern design principles to ensure the project's aesthetic appeal while maintaining consistency with Quora's branding and user experience guidelines. By adhering to best practices in coding standards and documentation, I ensured the project's scalability and maintainability for future iterations.</p>
